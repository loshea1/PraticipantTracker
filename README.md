# PraticipantTracker
This app is intended to be used as a tracker for participants progress for a multi-visit study.   It uses the date of baseline, completion, and dropout (if applicable) to determine where they are at in the study. It will calculate how many dropouts/withdrawls, in-progress, and completed subjects there are.
